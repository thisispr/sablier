# Configuration

There are three ways to define configuration options in Sablier:

1. In a configuration file
2. As environment variables
3. As command-line arguments

These methods are evaluated in the order listed above, with later methods overriding earlier ones.

If no value is provided for a given option, a default value is used.

## Instance Labels

Instance labels are applied directly to your containers or workloads. They control how Sablier discovers and manages each instance.

| Label | Required | Example | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `sablier.enable` | Yes | `"true"` | Opt the instance into Sablier management. Any value other than `"true"` is ignored. |
| `sablier.group` | No | `"myapp"` | Assign the instance to one or more named groups (comma-separated, e.g. `"team-a,team-b"`). Defaults to `"default"` when `sablier.enable=true` and no group is set. |
| `sablier.ready-after` | No | `"30s"` | Minimum duration to wait after the instance first reports ready before Sablier considers it truly ready. Accepts any Go duration string (`"500ms"`, `"1m30s"`, …). Useful for services that are started or pass their health check before they can actually serve traffic. |
| `sablier.ready-on-start` | No | `"true"` | Treat the instance as ready as soon as the start is dispatched. Useful for background services where the main app doesn't need them healthy to function. |
| `sablier.running-hours` | No | `"09:00-18:00"` | Daily keep-warm window in local time (`HH:MM-HH:MM`). Sablier starts the instance at window start and keeps it running until window end. Overnight windows like `"22:00-06:00"` are supported. |
| `sablier.running-days` | No | `"Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri"` | Restrict the `sablier.running-hours` window to specific weekdays. Comma-separated list accepting full names (`Monday`) and abbreviations (`Mon`). Defaults to every day when unset. |
| `sablier.anti-affinity` | No | `"streaming"` | Comma-separated group names this instance backs off from. While any listed group has an active session, Sablier forces this instance idle and restores it once none are active. See [Anti-Affinity](#anti-affinity). |
| `sablier.idle.cpu` | No | `"0.1"` | CPU limit applied when the session expires (scale mode). Requires `sablier.idle.replicas >= 1`. |
| `sablier.idle.memory` | No | `"128m"` | Memory limit applied when the session expires (scale mode). Requires `sablier.idle.replicas >= 1`. |
| `sablier.idle.replicas` | No | `"1"` | Replica count when idle. Default `0` (stop the workload). Set to `1` or higher to keep the workload running and optionally throttle its resources. |
| `sablier.active.cpu` | No | `"2.0"` | CPU limit restored when a new session is requested (scale mode). |
| `sablier.active.memory` | No | `"512m"` | Memory limit restored when a new session is requested (scale mode). |
| `sablier.active.replicas` | No | `"1"` | Replica count when active. Default `1`. Increase when you need more replicas on wake-up. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-weight` | No | `"100"` | Relative block I/O weight (`10`–`1000`) applied when idle (scale mode, Docker only). Requires `sablier.idle.replicas >= 1`. |
| `sablier.active.blkio-weight` | No | `"500"` | Block I/O weight (`10`–`1000`) restored when active. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-weight-device` | No | `"/dev/sda:100"` | Per-device I/O weight (`10`–`1000`). Comma-separated for multiple devices. Requires daemon API ≥ 1.55 (see note below). |
| `sablier.active.blkio-weight-device` | No | `"/dev/sda:500"` | Per-device I/O weight restored when active. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-bps` | No | `"/dev/sda:10m"` | Per-device read throughput limit. Rate uses Docker units (`10m` = 10 MB/s). Requires daemon API ≥ 1.55. |
| `sablier.active.blkio-device-read-bps` | No | `"/dev/sda:100m"` | Read throughput limit restored when active. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-bps` | No | `"/dev/sda:10m"` | Per-device write throughput limit. Requires daemon API ≥ 1.55. |
| `sablier.active.blkio-device-write-bps` | No | `"/dev/sda:100m"` | Write throughput limit restored when active. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-iops` | No | `"/dev/sda:100"` | Per-device read IOPS limit (plain integer). Requires daemon API ≥ 1.55. |
| `sablier.active.blkio-device-read-iops` | No | `"/dev/sda:1000"` | Read IOPS limit restored when active. |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-iops` | No | `"/dev/sda:100"` | Per-device write IOPS limit (plain integer). Requires daemon API ≥ 1.55. |
| `sablier.active.blkio-device-write-iops` | No | `"/dev/sda:1000"` | Write IOPS limit restored when active. |

### Multiple groups per instance

An instance can belong to more than one group by providing a **comma-separated** list in the `sablier.group` label:

```yaml
services:
  shared-api:
    image: myorg/shared-api:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=team-a,team-b"   # member of both groups
```

When a session is requested for `team-a`, Sablier starts every instance whose groups include `team-a` — including `shared-api`. The same instance is also started when a session for `team-b` is requested.

Practical rules:

- Spaces around commas are ignored: `"team-a , team-b"` is equivalent to `"team-a,team-b"`.
- Duplicate group names are deduplicated silently.
- An instance that loses all group labels (e.g. label removed at runtime) is dropped from every group it belonged to.

!> For **ProxmoxLXC** the label model is replaced by Proxmox tags. Add one `sablier-group-<name>` tag per group (e.g. `sablier-group-team-a` and `sablier-group-team-b`).

### `sablier.ready-after`

Some services are started (or pass their health check) before they finish initialising — for example a JVM application that opens its HTTP port before loading all caches, a database that accepts TCP connections before it's ready for queries, or any container without a health check that needs a few extra seconds after start-up before it can serve traffic.

Setting `sablier.ready-after` introduces a mandatory settling delay. Once the provider reports the instance as ready — whether that means it has started or passed its health check — Sablier continues to return a *not-ready* response to any blocking or dynamic request until the grace period elapses.

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=myapp"
      - "sablier.ready-after=30s"  # wait 30 s after started/healthy before unblocking requests
```

The value is a Go duration string. Valid examples:

| Value | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| `500ms` | 500 milliseconds |
| `30s` | 30 seconds |
| `1m30s` | 1 minute 30 seconds |
| `2m` | 2 minutes |

If the label is absent or set to an unparseable value, no extra wait is applied.

!> The `sablier.ready-after` grace period counts from when the instance **first** becomes ready in a given session. It does not reset on subsequent requests.

### `sablier.ready-on-start`

Some services only run in the background — NVR recorders, cache sidecars,
build agents, etc. The main application works without them being healthy, but
you still want Sablier to start them when a request arrives.

Setting `sablier.ready-on-start=true` tells Sablier to dispatch the start but
immediately treat the instance as ready, skipping the health check. The reverse
proxy passes the request through without waiting.

```yaml
services:
  frigate:
    image: frigate:latest
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=home"
      - "sablier.ready-on-start=true"   # start frigate, don't wait for health
```

- Only the instance with `sablier.ready-on-start=true` is affected. Other
  instances in the same session still wait for their health checks normally.
- Accepts a Go boolean value (`"true"`, `"1"`, …). Invalid values are ignored with a warning.
  An empty or absent value means no special treatment.
- Works with both dynamic and blocking strategies — no plugin-side changes needed.

### `sablier.running-hours`

Use `sablier.running-hours` when an instance must stay available during specific daily hours.

Behavior:

- At the beginning of the configured period, Sablier proactively starts the instance.
- During the running-hours period, request-triggered sessions are extended to the period end so the instance is not stopped in the middle of the window.
- After the period ends, normal session expiration resumes.

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=myapp"
      - "sablier.running-hours=09:00-18:00"
```

Format rules:

- Use 24-hour format `HH:MM-HH:MM`.
- If start is later than end (for example `22:00-06:00`), the window spans midnight.
- If the label cannot be parsed, Sablier ignores it.

### `sablier.running-days`

Use `sablier.running-days` together with `sablier.running-hours` to restrict the keep-warm window to specific weekdays. This is useful to only keep an instance warm during, for example, weekdays.

Behavior:

- When set, the `sablier.running-hours` window only applies on the listed days.
- When absent, the window applies every day.
- For overnight windows (e.g. `22:00-06:00`), the day is evaluated against the day the window **starts**. For example, a `Fri` window with `22:00-06:00` keeps the instance warm from Friday 22:00 through Saturday 06:00.

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=myapp"
      - "sablier.running-hours=09:00-18:00"
      - "sablier.running-days=Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri"
```

Format rules:

- Comma-separated list of days.
- Accepts full names (`Monday`) and common abbreviations (`Mon`).
- Matching is case-insensitive; surrounding whitespace is ignored.
- If the label cannot be parsed, Sablier ignores it (the window then applies every day).

### Timezone (`TZ`)

Running-hours are evaluated in the process local timezone.

- In the official Docker image, the binary embeds timezone database data and supports `TZ` out of the box.
- The container defaults to `TZ=UTC`.
- Override timezone with environment variables, for example `-e TZ=Europe/Paris`.

### Scale Mode

Scale mode is an alternative to stopping containers. Instead of shutting down and restarting the workload, Sablier **scales down the replica count** when the session expires and **restores it** when a new session is requested.

Optionally, when `sablier.idle.replicas >= 1`, the workload **keeps running** at the idle replica count with **throttled CPU and memory**, and resources are **restored** when a new session arrives. This eliminates cold-start latency at the cost of keeping the workload alive.

| Label | Format | Default | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| `sablier.idle.replicas` | Integer | `0` (stop) | `"1"` |
| `sablier.idle.cpu` | Decimal cores (Docker/Swarm) or Kubernetes quantity | — | `"0.1"`, `"500m"` |
| `sablier.idle.memory` | Docker units or Kubernetes quantity | — | `"64m"`, `"128Mi"` |
| `sablier.active.replicas` | Integer | `1` | `"2"` |
| `sablier.active.cpu` | Decimal cores (Docker/Swarm) or Kubernetes quantity | — | `"2.0"`, `"2000m"` |
| `sablier.active.memory` | Docker units or Kubernetes quantity | — | `"512m"`, `"1Gi"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-weight` / `sablier.active.blkio-weight` | Integer `10`–`1000` (Docker only) | — | `"100"`, `"500"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-weight-device` / `sablier.active.blkio-weight-device` | `path:weight` list (Docker only) | — | `"/dev/sda:100"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-bps` / `sablier.active.blkio-device-read-bps` | `path:rate` list, Docker units (Docker only) | — | `"/dev/sda:10m"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-bps` / `sablier.active.blkio-device-write-bps` | `path:rate` list, Docker units (Docker only) | — | `"/dev/sda:10m"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-iops` / `sablier.active.blkio-device-read-iops` | `path:iops` list (Docker only) | — | `"/dev/sda:100"` |
| `sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-iops` / `sablier.active.blkio-device-write-iops` | `path:iops` list (Docker only) | — | `"/dev/sda:100"` |

When `sablier.idle.replicas` is `0` (the default), Sablier stops the workload on session expiry and restarts it on demand — identical to the default stop behavior, but configured via scale-mode labels. Set it to `1` or higher to keep the workload running with optional resource throttling.

You can set any combination of the CPU and memory labels. Labels not set default to no limit (no throttling applied).

**Supported providers:** Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes (Deployments and StatefulSets), Podman.

> Proxmox LXC does not support scale mode because it uses tag-based configuration rather than key-value labels.

#### Docker / Podman

CPU values are decimal fractions of one core (`"0.5"` = half a core). Memory values use Docker-style suffixes (`b`, `k`, `m`, `g`).

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=myapp"
      - "sablier.idle.replicas=1"
      - "sablier.idle.cpu=0.1"
      - "sablier.idle.memory=64m"
      - "sablier.active.replicas=1"
      - "sablier.active.cpu=2.0"
      - "sablier.active.memory=512m"
```

When the session expires, Sablier sets the replica count to `sablier.idle.replicas` (≥ 1 keeps the container running) and runs the equivalent of `docker update --cpus=0.1 --memory=64m myapp`. When a new session is requested, it restores `--cpus=2.0 --memory=512m`. The container is never stopped.

> **Note:** Docker requires the memory swap limit to be updated in the same call as the memory limit. Sablier sets `MemorySwap` equal to `Memory` automatically, which satisfies the constraint and disables swap for the container.

##### Block I/O (blkio) throttling

In addition to CPU and memory, the **Docker** provider can throttle block I/O in scale mode. This is useful when an idle workload should keep running but must not compete with active workloads for disk bandwidth.

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=myapp"
      - "sablier.idle.replicas=1"
      # Global relative weight (10–1000)
      - "sablier.idle.blkio-weight=100"
      - "sablier.active.blkio-weight=500"
      # Per-device limits (comma-separate multiple devices: "/dev/sda:10m,/dev/sdb:5m")
      - "sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-bps=/dev/sda:10m"
      - "sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-bps=/dev/sda:10m"
      - "sablier.idle.blkio-device-read-iops=/dev/sda:100"
      - "sablier.idle.blkio-device-write-iops=/dev/sda:100"
```

- `blkio-weight` is a relative I/O scheduling weight in the range `10`–`1000`. Values outside that range (or the value `0`) are ignored.
- `*-bps` rates accept Docker-style byte units (`10m` = 10 MB/s, `100k` = 100 KB/s).
- `*-iops` rates are plain integers.
- Per-device values are `path:value` pairs; separate multiple devices with commas.
- As with CPU/memory, a limit set on the idle profile is **not** cleared automatically on wake-up. To restore full I/O, set the corresponding `sablier.active.*` label (e.g. a higher `blkio-weight` or a larger rate).

!> **Per-device blkio limits require a Docker daemon with API version ≥ 1.55.** Older daemons accept the update request but silently ignore the per-device fields (`blkio-weight-device`, `blkio-device-read-bps`, `blkio-device-write-bps`, `blkio-device-read-iops`, `blkio-device-write-iops`) — the container's cgroup is left unchanged. See [moby/moby#52650](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/52650). Sablier logs a warning when it detects this situation. The global `blkio-weight` label is unaffected and works on all supported Docker versions.

#### Docker Swarm

CPU and memory values use the same format as Docker. Resource constraints are applied to the service's task template, triggering a Swarm service update (tasks are re-scheduled with the new limits).

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    image: myapp:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      labels:
        - "sablier.enable=true"
        - "sablier.group=myapp"
        - "sablier.idle.replicas=1"
        - "sablier.idle.cpu=0.1"
        - "sablier.idle.memory=64m"
        - "sablier.active.replicas=1"
        - "sablier.active.cpu=2.0"
        - "sablier.active.memory=512m"
```

> **Note:** In Docker Swarm, labels that control Sablier must be placed under `deploy.labels`, not the top-level `labels` key, so that they are attached to the service rather than the container.

#### Kubernetes

CPU and memory values use the standard [Kubernetes resource quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes) format (`"500m"`, `"2"`, `"128Mi"`, `"1Gi"`).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    sablier.enable: "true"
    sablier.group: myapp
    sablier.idle.replicas: "1"
    sablier.idle.cpu: "100m"
    sablier.idle.memory: "64Mi"
    sablier.active.replicas: "1"
    sablier.active.cpu: "2000m"
    sablier.active.memory: "512Mi"
```

> **Note:** Kubernetes resource limit changes trigger a **rolling restart** of the pods. The service remains available during the transition (old pods are replaced with new ones), but there will be brief overlap between old and new pods.

!> Scale mode changes resource **limits**, not requests. Ensure your nodes have sufficient allocatable capacity for the active limits.

### Anti-Affinity

Anti-affinity lets an instance **back off automatically** whenever another workload is in use. It is designed for machines where several heavy services compete for a shared, non-shareable resource — most commonly **GPU VRAM or RAM** — and running two of them at once causes an out-of-memory crash or severe slowdown.

An instance declares the groups it must yield to with the `sablier.anti-affinity` label:

```yaml
services:
  # Plex is the "streaming" service.
  plex:
    image: plexinc/pms-docker
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.group=streaming"

  # Nextcloud keeps running in the background, but must free the GPU/RAM
  # whenever a streaming session is active.
  nextcloud:
    image: nextcloud
    labels:
      - "sablier.enable=true"
      - "sablier.anti-affinity=streaming"   # yield to the "streaming" group
      # Optional: use scale mode so "idle" means throttled instead of stopped.
      - "sablier.idle.replicas=1"
      - "sablier.idle.cpu=0.5"
      - "sablier.active.cpu=4.0"
```

How it works:

- When a session for the **`streaming`** group becomes active, every instance that declared `sablier.anti-affinity=streaming` is forced to its **idle** state:
  - a plain instance is **stopped** (or paused, depending on the strategy);
  - a scale-mode instance (`sablier.idle.replicas >= 1`) has its **idle resource profile** applied instead.
- When the `streaming` session **expires** and no other listed group is active, the instances Sablier forced idle are **restored** — restarted, or returned to their active resource profile.
- Multiple antagonist groups can be listed (`sablier.anti-affinity=streaming,transcoding`); the instance stays idle while **any** of them is active.

Behavior notes:

- Only instances Sablier **actually suppressed while they were running** are restored later — an instance that was already idle is left untouched.
- The relationship is **one-directional**: the declaring instance yields to the group, not the reverse.
- **Requesting a held instance:** while an antagonist group is active, a request for the backing-off instance does **not** start it. It is reported as `not-ready` with the message *"paused while group \"streaming\" is active (anti-affinity)"*, which appears on the waiting page (with `show_details`) and in the API response. A **blocking** request keeps waiting and will time out if the antagonist outlasts its timeout; the **dynamic** waiting page keeps refreshing and starts the instance automatically once the antagonist expires.
- Anti-affinity instances must be **Sablier-managed** (`sablier.enable=true`) so Sablier can stop and start them.
- Reconciliation is reactive (on session start and expiry) with a periodic safety net, so backing off is fast enough to avoid the collision that motivated the feature.

**Supported providers:** the same as scale mode — Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Podman. Proxmox LXC is not supported (tag-based configuration).

## Configuration File

At startup, Sablier searches for a configuration file named `sablier.yml` (or `sablier.yaml`) in the following locations:

- `/etc/sablier/`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/`
- `$HOME/.config/`
- `.` *(the working directory)*

You can override this by using the `configFile` argument:

```bash
sablier --configFile=path/to/myconfigfile.yml
```

```yaml
provider:
  # Provider to use to manage containers (docker, swarm, kubernetes, podman, proxmox_lxc)
  name: docker
  # Stop all sablier.enable=true instances that are running at startup and were not started by Sablier (default: true)
  auto-stop-on-startup: true
  # Continuously stop instances with sablier.enable=true that are running but were not started by Sablier (default: false)
  # Uses both event-driven detection and a periodic reconciliation scan (every 30 seconds) as a safety net.
  auto-stop-externally-started: false
  # Continuously create a session (with the default session duration) for instances with sablier.enable=true
  # that are running but were not started by Sablier, instead of stopping them (default: false)
  # This is the non-destructive counterpart to auto-stop-externally-started (the two options are
  # mutually exclusive): the instance keeps running until its seeded session expires, then hibernates
  # through the regular expiration lifecycle. Uses both event-driven detection and a periodic
  # reconciliation scan (every 30 seconds) as a safety net.
  # Pair it with auto-stop-on-startup: false, otherwise instances already running when Sablier
  # boots are stopped once at startup before the warm watch takes over.
  auto-warm-externally-started: false
  # Reject direct named requests for instances without sablier.enable=true
  reject-unlabeled-requests: false
  # Verify sablier.enable=true before stopping expired instances
  verify-enabled-on-expiration: false
  docker:
    # Strategy to use for stopping Docker containers: stop or pause (default: stop)
    strategy: stop

  # The server port to use
  port: 10000 
  # The base path for the API
  base-path: /

```

## server.metrics.enabled

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `server.metrics.enabled` | `false` | Expose a Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint. |

When set to `true`, Sablier registers a `GET <base-path>/metrics` route on the same HTTP server that handles `/health` and `/api/...`. The route returns the Prometheus text exposition format and is served by `promhttp`. When set to `false` (the default), the route is not registered and any request to that path returns `404`.

### Exposed metrics

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| `sablier_group_locked` | gauge | `group` | `1` if any instance in the group has an active session, else `0`. One series per known group, including groups with no active sessions. |
| `sablier_group_active_instances` | gauge | `group` | Number of instances in the group that currently have an active session. |
| `sablier_session_expires_at_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | `instance`, `group` | Unix timestamp (seconds) at which the instance's session expires and the instance is stopped. One series per active session. The value tracks the latest access, so it is pushed back on every session renewal. Derive the remaining time in Grafana with `sablier_session_expires_at_timestamp_seconds - time()`. |
| `sablier_instance_start_duration_seconds` | histogram | `instance` | Duration of `provider.InstanceStart` calls (seconds). Observed only on success. |
| `sablier_instance_ready_duration_seconds` | histogram | `instance` | End-to-end wall time from first not-ready observation to ready (seconds). |
| `sablier_session_requests_total` | counter | `strategy` (`dynamic`\|`blocking`), `target` (`names`\|`group`) | Total number of session requests received. |
| `sablier_instance_start_failures_total` | counter | `instance` | Total number of `provider.InstanceStart` failures. |
| `sablier_instance_stops_total` | counter | `instance`, `reason` (`expired`\|`unregistered`) | Total number of instance stops. |
| Go runtime + process collectors | (default) | (default) | Standard `go_*` and `process_*` metrics from the Prometheus Go client. |

### Security note

The endpoint exposes process internals, group and instance names, and counters. It is intended for trusted observability stacks. Restrict at the reverse proxy when Sablier is fronted on an untrusted network.

## Environment Variables

All configuration options can be set as environment variables. The variable names follow the structure of the configuration file and are prefixed with `SABLIER_`.

For example, this configuration:

```yaml
strategy:
  dynamic:
    custom-themes-path: /my/path
```
